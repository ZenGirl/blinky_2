# blinky2 - A simply CLI for search

This is a simple CLI program to handle the ZenDesk code challenge.
The original PDF is in the `docs` directory.

The current ruby version is `2.6.2` as noted in the `.ruby-version` file.

The gemset is named `blinky_2` as this is a 2nd shot at doing the challenge.

The project name comes from the Blinky Bill comics.
